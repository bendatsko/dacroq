    content: `Dacroq is a powerful web interface for solving complex mathematical problems through our API. Our platform currently supports 3-SAT solving, with K-SAT and LDPC solvers coming soon.

## What is Dacroq?
The website dacroq.eecs.umich.edu acts as a web interface for an API. This API is used to control a SAT solver, a K-SAT solver, and an LDPC solver. Currently, only the SAT solver is operational.

## Platform Overview
Dacroq provides:
- Real-time solving capabilities for SAT problems
- User-friendly web interface
- Comprehensive API access
- Detailed performance metrics and benchmarking
- Support for multiple input formats`

    title: "Quick Start Guide",
    content: `## Running the 3-SAT Solver

Follow these steps to get started with your first test:

1. Prepare your input using one of these formats:
   - .cnf file
   - .zip file containing multiple .cnf files
   - Pre-loaded problems (configurable range)
   - Single problem in plaintext

2. Use the user interface to enter this configuration and press run
3. Wait for your test status to update to "Completed"
4. View results and analyze performance

## Test Management
The recent tests table shows all tests run by all users. Key features:
- All users can see all tests
- Tests can be deleted by any user
- Real-time status updates
- Comprehensive result viewing

## Input Types
Dacroq supports multiple input formats:
- Single CNF files
- Batch processing via ZIP files
- Pre-configured problem sets
- Direct plaintext input
  
## Quick Tips
- Monitor test status in real-time
- Download benchmark data for detailed analysis
- Use the reset function if needed
- Check success rates and performance metrics`
