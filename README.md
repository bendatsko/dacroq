# Hybrid Hardware-Software SAT Solver

This project implements a hybrid SAT solver approach that combines the WalkSAT software algorithm with hardware acceleration to efficiently solve Boolean satisfiability problems.

## Overview

The hybrid SAT solver intelligently combines the strengths of software SAT solving with hardware acceleration:

- **Software Solver**: Uses the WalkSAT algorithm, a randomized algorithm for solving boolean satisfiability problems.
- **Hardware Accelerator**: Simulates or interfaces with specialized SAT-solving hardware that can solve certain problem classes more efficiently.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Intelligently decides when to use software, hardware, or a combination of both based on problem characteristics.

## Architecture

The system consists of the following main components:

### 1. WalkSAT Software Solver

A Go implementation of the WalkSAT algorithm that:
- Parses DIMACS CNF format
- Uses probabilistic heuristics to find satisfying assignments
- Tracks unsatisfied clauses for efficiency
- Implements periodic restarts for escaping local minima

### 2. Hardware Accelerator Interface

An interface for SAT-solving hardware:
- Defines common operations (initialize, solve, offload partial problems)
- Includes a simulated hardware accelerator for testing
- Can be extended to support actual hardware devices

### 3. Hybrid Solver

The intelligent component that decides how to solve each problem:
- Analyzes problem characteristics (size, clause structure, etc.)
- Makes decisions about whether to use hardware acceleration
- Implements coordination between software and hardware phases
- Collects statistics about solver performance

## Implementation Details

### Hardware Decision Logic

The system uses several heuristics to decide when to use hardware:

1. **Problem Size**: Hardware is preferred for problems within its capacity limits
2. **Clause-to-Variable Ratio**: Hardware excels at problems near the phase transition (ratio ~4.26 for 3-SAT)
3. **Clause Structure**: Some hardware is optimized for specific clause patterns (e.g., 3-SAT)
4. **Current Progress**: When software stalls (few unsatisfied clauses), hardware can be used for refinement

### Hybrid Solving Approach

1. **Initial Analysis**: Evaluate the problem to determine if hardware would be beneficial
2. **Pure Hardware Solution**: Try hardware first for suitable problems
3. **Hybrid Solution**: For complex problems, the solver may:
   - Start with software to reduce complexity
   - Periodically offload partial solutions to hardware
   - Resume software solving with improved assignments from hardware
   - Switch between approaches based on progress

### Simulated Hardware

The included simulated hardware accelerator:
- Models real hardware performance characteristics
- Applies speedup factors to estimate hardware execution time
- Simulates different success rates for different problem types
- Provides API-compatible interface for testing without actual hardware

## Setup Instructions

### Setting up the Web Interface

### Programmatic Usage

```go
import "dacroq/walksat"

// Parse DIMACS file
formula, _ := walksat.ParseDIMACS("problem.cnf")

// Initialize hardware
hardware := walksat.NewSimulatedAccelerator()

// Configure hybrid solver
config := walksat.DefaultHybridConfig()
config.MaxSoftwareSteps = 50000
config.MaxHardwareTime = 5000
config.UnsatThreshold = 5

// Solve using hybrid approach
result, _ := walksat.HybridSolve(formula, hardware, config)

// Check result
if result.SolutionFound {
    fmt.Println("Solution:", result.SolutionString)
    fmt.Printf("Time: %.2f Î¼s\n", result.ComputationTime)
} else {
    fmt.Println("No solution found")
}
```

## Performance

The hybrid approach offers several advantages:

1. **Speed**: Hardware acceleration can be orders of magnitude faster for suitable problems
2. **Energy Efficiency**: Hardware often uses significantly less energy than software
3. **Flexibility**: Can handle a wider range of problems than either approach alone
4. **Adaptability**: Makes intelligent decisions based on problem characteristics

Benchmark results vary by problem type, but the hybrid approach generally shows the most consistent performance across problem classes.

## Running Tests

To run tests for the hybrid solver:

```
cd api
go test ./walksat -v
```

To run benchmarks:

```
cd api
go test ./walksat -bench=. -benchmem
```

## Future Work

1. Integration with actual hardware accelerators
2. Improved decision-making heuristics based on machine learning
3. Support for more SAT problem types and specialized encodings
4. Distributed solving across multiple hardware accelerators
